# Anime Clicky Game

## Overview

Clicky Game is a React application that's a memory game. The goal of the game is to click on each character without clicking without clicking on the same character twice. Each time the user clicks on a character the order of the images will shuffle on the screen to make things a little more difficult. If the user clicks on the same character twice they'll get a game over alert. If the user is able to click on all the charcters without clicking on the same one twice they'll get an alert telling them they won. The app is able to keep track of they user's current score and previous high score as well.
